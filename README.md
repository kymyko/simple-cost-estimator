# Cost Estimator

This project is a simple cost estimator web page designed to help users estimate their costs based on different plans. It includes HTML markup for the structure and CSS styling for the presentation.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) consists of the following components:

- **Document Type Declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`):** Defines the document type and version of HTML used.
- **Head Section:** Contains metadata such as character set, viewport settings, and external stylesheets.
- **Body Section:** Contains the main content of the web page, including the title, header, container, tabs, session card, slider, and card wrappers.

## CSS Styling

The CSS file (`style.css`) provides styling for various elements to enhance the appearance and layout of the web page. Key styling includes:

- Setting background colors, fonts, and layout properties for the body and container elements.
- Styling tabs, toggles, session cards, sliders, and cards.
- Applying transitions and hover effects to buttons and cards for interactive elements.

## Responsive Design

The CSS styling ensures that the web page is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. Notably, the `.cards-wrapper` class utilizes flexbox with `flex-wrap: wrap` property to ensure proper layout when screen width is reduced.

## Usage

To use this project, simply download the HTML and CSS files and place them in the same directory. You can then open the HTML file in a web browser to view the cost estimator web page.
